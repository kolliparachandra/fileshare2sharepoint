<Management>

•	Enable

        Turns the program ON or OFF completely  

•	RunAs account

        this is the account that does the “heavy lifting” on behalf of the users.  Copying or moving files.

        Every occurrence of an error will be logged


<Alerts>

•	enableAlerts
        This is code that will set SharePoint alerts for everyone in the specifieded group
        All users will receive the same settings, so create a new group for this purpose and only include those that want an alert set up for them.
        Turning this component OFF once alerts have been set up does NOT remove users alerts but will prevent new ones from being created.
        Users who no longer want to receive alerts will need to turn them off manually.
        Configures SharePoint alerts on or off
        Possible values - "On" or "OFF"


•	group
        Configures the group that you wish to set up SharePoint alerts/notifications

        Members are free to modify the parameters of their own alerts
        Possible values - valid AD group


•	deliveryChannels
        Configures the setting that determines how users will be alerted
        Possible values - EMAIL/SMS

        Possible values - LIST/Item/Custom

<AppSettings>

•	Monitor Directory
        The path to the directory that is to be monitored by the program

•	Subdirectories
        Determines whether subdirectories of the Monitor Directory will also be monitored for file activity
        Possible values - $true OR $FALSE

        Default is 99-9999-9999.99.99-*.pdf where:
        99 is 2 digit year of case
        -
        9999 is case number
        -
        9999 is 4 digit year of case
        .
        99 is 2 digit month of case 
        .
        99 is 2 digit day of case
        -
        * is badge number, followed by any string of characters
        .
        pdf  file type

        ** Note - this is NOT the best way of storing files by putting metadata into the name. 
        Besides, the file naming could be automated and SPsearch should do slice and dice

        ** Note - it currently does not support rejecting any file that contains a string such as WIP, or work in progress.
        We probably want to implment something that is simpler.Just putting any string "non-numeric" a the start will ensure the file is not copied/moved.

•	WebURL
        The path to which the document library exists

•	DocumentLibrary
        The name of the Sharepoint document library
